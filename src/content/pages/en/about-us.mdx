### Our Story
We are a small team from Zurich, Switzerland, dedicated to providing high-quality services and products for the Educational Technology industry.

### Values
- Evolutionary: We are committed to continuous incremental improvements.
- Empathetic: We prioritize understanding and addressing the needs of our users.
- Aspirational: We start with small projects and aim to grow into larger solutions.

### Inspirations
While navigating the busy landscape of modern education, we noticed something troubling: LMS platforms were abundant and feature-rich, yet often frustrating to use. Simple tasks like preparing a lesson or grading assignments in Moodle could feel like a struggle. We believe educators deserve better tools that work with them, not against them. That's why we started building EdTech products designed to simplify, support, and empower teaching.

### Team
- Robin: \
From a young üë¶ age I was enthusiastic about technology. Especially computers üíª and software development üë®‚Äçüíª caught my interest. I like to develop web applications and apps for mobile devices. Also in the future, I intend to focus on this topics and elaborate my knowledge about them.
It's easy and fun for me to interact with colleagues to bring a project further and reach given targets. I can take responsibility for a small team and lead it with clear instructions and an agile project management on wards.
- Yixuan: \
With a background in Natural Language Processing and a passion for thoughtful design, I transitioned into web and software development to build tools and experiences that are both functional and visually engaging. I enjoy turning ideas into working products‚Äîespecially when I can shape both how they look and how they work.

### Future Goals
We envision a future where managing course content is seamless, collaborative, and fully version-controlled. Our goal is to become a trusted solution for educational institutions, empowering them to create, organize, and deliver high-quality learning experiences with ease. Starting with Moodle integrations, we're building toward a flexible content management system that simplifies workflows and scales with real educational needs.
